# Field Notes

The fixture is small on purpose, which makes each domain case carry real weight.

The domain cases cover `trust boundary`, `claim drift`, `replay exposure`, and `policy width`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

The widest spread is between `trust boundary` and `policy width`, so those are the first two cases I would preserve during a refactor.

The language-specific addition keeps the review model as queryable sqlite views and assertions.
